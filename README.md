## ðŸš€ Routes

### ðŸŽ® Games

| Verb   | URI Pattern  | Controller#Action |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| GET    | `/games`     | `games#index`     |
| POST   | `/games`     | `games#create`    |
| GET    | `/games/:id` | `games#show`      |
| PATCH  | `/games/:id` | `games#update`    |
| DELETE | `/games/:id` | `games#delete`    |

### ðŸ‘¤ NPCs

| Verb  | URI Pattern | Controller#Action |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| POST  | `/npcs`     | `npcs#create`     |
| GET   | `/npcs/:id` | `npcs#show`       |
| PATCH | `/npcs/:id` | `npcs#update`     |

> There are paths to index all npcs or delete an npc, but they are currently not in use. They are not a protected resource and can be edited via cURL scripts. If an npc from a game were deleted, the game would break.
